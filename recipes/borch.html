    <h1>Ukrainian Borch</h1>

    <h2>
        If you don't know what is borscht, it is vibrant red color soup with cabbage, beets, potatoes, carrots, onion and garlic, and possibly beef and beans. Then served with sour cream and dill. Essentially, this borscht is a superfood and a meal in itself.

    </h2>

    <p>
        Traditional borscht recipe definitely tastes like beets, sweet and tangy. Earthy flavors of beets truly shine through in this dish.

    </p>

    <p>
        It is also kind of sweet and sour soup. We add vinegar and a little bit of sugar to compliment natural sweetness of root vegetables.

    </p>

    <p>
        And lots of fresh dill and garlic after this delicious Ukrainian beetroot soup is cooked. As much as you like to personal preference, and us, Ukrainians, like to add a lot!

        <li><b>Prep veggies:</b> You want to start with cabbage first because it takes the longest time to cook. While it is cooking, you can prep other vegetables.
